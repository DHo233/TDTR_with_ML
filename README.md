# TDTR_with_ML

It is the first project of my study of Machine Learning, it includes:
1. A small intro project to ML (a classifier).
2. A year-long national research SRTP project: Predict Material Properties and Solve Partial Differential Equations of Physical Models Based on Neural Network Algorithm. The project aims to predict the unknown parameters of a certain material, which based on neural network algorithm. It focused more on ML application on physics field, which based on a physical method called Time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR).
3. The whole process of the project recorded by documents (From the approval of the project to interim report, and finally to closing report).

## Personal Intro to ML
`Classifier_He.py` and `Network_Model` are the intro code of ML, which is used to build a model that classify the images in the folder `coil-20-proc`.

## TDTR with ML
`New_6.py` is the final code of this project. `Noise_1` and `Noise_2` are two different methods to reduce the impact of noise in actual scene.

## Process of project
Other files including `ProjectApproval.pdf``InterimReport.pdf` and so on are the recording of the process of our project. 
Because the seminar slides are not complete, you can refer to [my blog](https://www.cnblogs.com/Hexh/), there are some logs when I was doing this project and other projects.
